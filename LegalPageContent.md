This is an project aimed to provide bare HTTP proxy under 4G/LTE with multiple proxy auto-config File or manual configuration, allowing you to manage your network with multiple PAC files. Since I'm just an amateur to Swift development and the project itself is more like a proof of concept prototype, instead of some serious long-term maintainable engineering product, I won't provide any kind of warranty, or any kind of "will fix ASAP" promise. For the same reason, I will also not write any kind of Test/Unit Test.

It will keep free, without any kind of advertisement or In-App-Purchase. If you really enjoy using this app, think about star my project: https://github.com/cnnblike/discord.git

**YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE, ANY KIND OF OPEN PROXY IS DANGEROUS, JUST USE THE ONE YOU CAN TRUST!**

To implement this project, I've used several open-source project, including, but not limited to: [Alamofire/Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), [Alamofire/Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage), [zhuhaow/NEKit](https://github.com/zhuhaow/NEKit).
