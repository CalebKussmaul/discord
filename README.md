# Compiling on Xcode 14

Carthege is required, but has problems on M1. Use the included carthege.sh script to build

1. run `./carthage.sh update --no-use-binaries --platform ios`
2. in Signing & Capabilities select your personal account and change the bundle identifier to something unique
3. install to your physical device. Compilation will fail for simulators

# discord

This is an project aimed to provide bare HTTP proxy under 4G/LTE with multiple proxy auto-config File or manual configuration, allowing you to manage your network with multiple PAC files. Since I'm just an amateur to Swift development and the project itself is more like a proof of concept prototype, instead of some serious long-term maintainable engineering product, I won't provide any kind of warranty, or any kind of "will fix ASAP" promise. For the same reason, I will also not write any kind of Test/Unit Test.

It will keep free, without any kind of advertisement or In-App-Purchase. If you really enjoy using this app, think about star my project: https://github.com/cnnblike/discord.git

**YOU SHOULD ALSO BE AWARE, ANY KIND OF OPEN PROXY IS DANGEROUS, JUST USE THE ONE YOU CAN TRUST!**

To implement this, I've used several open-source project, including, but not limited to: [Alamofire/Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire), [Alamofire/AlamofireImage](https://github.com/Alamofire/AlamofireImage), [zhuhaow/NEKit](https://github.com/zhuhaow/NEKit). Many thanks to these awesome project and their developer.

## How to build a QR Code conform to this app

This app accept QR code in two different content:

1. only one url to the PAC file. or

1. a JSON object with, but not limited to one of the following field pattern:

    a. `host` field + `port` field. The app will automatically interpreter the QR code as an authenticate-less proxy.

    b. `host` field + `port` field + `username` field + `password` field. The app will interpreter the QR code as a configuration for a proxy with authentication.

    c. `pacUrl` field or `pacContent` field. It will be interpreted as a PAC proxy.

To have an advanced configuration, we have even more configuration field available via JSON string QR scanner:

1. `enable`: is this proxy rule actually active?

1. `isAutomatic`: is this rule a Proxy Auto-Config one? Or it's a dumb "applied to all" rule?

1. `needAuthenticate`: is this proxy an authenticate one?

1. `username`: the username for proxy authentication

1. `host`: proxy host for manual.

1. `port`: proxy port for manual.

1. `password`: the password used for authentication

1. `pacUrl`: the url for pac file, used in automatic proxy.

1. `name`: field showing in the main ViewController.

1. `descriptor`: field for detail description in main ViewController.

1. `imageUrl`: field for image shown in main ViewController.

1. `pacContent`: this field contains what's in the pac file. **Only configurable via QR JSON.**

## How to build on your own

carthage update --no-use-binaries --platform ios
```
